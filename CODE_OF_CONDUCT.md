The consequences for violating the Code of Conduct are as follows:

Correction: A private, written warning from community leaders, explaining the nature of the violation and requesting a public apology if necessary.

Temporary Ban: Serious violations or sustained inappropriate behaviour may result in a temporary ban from any form of communication or interaction within the community.
